:heavy_check_mark: This code filters out codepoints on a page that do not match user input entered into the search input field. This is in reference to (link to the original issue).

:heavy_check_mark: This correction fixes the typo mentioned in (link to the original issue).

:x: :ghost: (_left blank_)

:x: I had an idea, so here's some code you might like.

**Test plan (required)**

Demonstrate the code is solid. Remember, VanillaJS is preferred, as the idea is to keep this running sans dependencies. Also, Azure Alphant uses a custom UI, icons, buttons, and the like may be suggested, but leave the actual implementation of UI design to me (SheilaRT). 

:heavy_check_mark: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos, plus any sceenshots of the code pasted into a linter that you'd like to add.

:x: I totally promise this works. Trust me.

:x: The documentation from the repo this is from says this should work.

**Code formatting**

Semantics, following standards, and commenting matter. Personal preferences like tabs vs. spaces, which can be adjusted later in the unlikely event it does become important, do not.

**Credit and license information**

Include the name(s) of everyone who worked on the pull request and include any additional information which should be added to the licensing of this repo in regards to your contribution.
