## How you can help

If you have an idea for a new character, you may send your request to [The Unicode Consortium](http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html). Azure Alphant merely displays characters The Unicode Consortium has already approved and has no power over what will or will not be accepted as part of the standard. Of course, you are also welcome to create a font with your own set of characters and map them to codepoints in the Private Use Areas created for that very purpose.
