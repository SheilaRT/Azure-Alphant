// If Google can't make a PWA that meets Google's criteria that the Google tool 'Lighthouse' tests for, then there's no sense trying to meet that standard on Azure Alphant just yet. As it turns out, while Azure Alphant meets all other Lighthouse-tested metrics (Performance, Best Practices, Accessibility, and SEO) with 4 lovely green 100% scores, many Google tools and apps scores are all over the place, even as far down as 22% in some cases, and generally meets less than half of the PWA requirements. Azure Alphant meets all but 3 PWA requirements, which is more than half. The 3 requirements Azure Alphant does not meet are: 1) Current page does not respond with a 200 when offline, 2) start_url does not respond with a 200 when offline, and 3) Does not register a service worker that controls page and start_url, all of which would be fixed with a working Service Worker script, but Google's own tutorial for writing one breaks at line two of the registration script.
// All Service Worker scripting, including the registration script in index.html, is currently removed, until such time as Service Workers actually, well, work. The offline.html file will remain as I may use it as a template in the future, perhaps for a 404 page, if neccessary.
